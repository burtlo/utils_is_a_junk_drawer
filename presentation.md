# Junk

> The style and theme of the slides are full color pictures of junk and drawers filled with junk. The words and images that appear over the slides fade in slowly to show information to assist the story and providing a second narrative. Over the slides the names of popular projects appear and then their stats.

> Later the slides show particular interesting tools or creations. The words and images share again appear over the slides fade in slowly. Each slide an interesting idea or concept found within the code. The thoughts shared here about the history that we weave and the way we see the world or wish it would work. Some emphasis on the extraction of these utilities into their own ideas or the inclusion in the guidance of the programming language we write.

## SLIDE - BLACK

Maybe it's because I was packing up the house for the third time in the short span of two years that started me thinking about it. There were boxes I hadn't had the chance to open. Projects and hobbies -- all covered in dust -- that I was filing back away.

That would make sense, that's when I was feeling overwhelmed with all the stuff around me, all this ... junk.

## SLIDE - JUNK

"Does having a junk drawer in my application make everything better or worse?"

Because in finding an unequivocal answer to that question could help me find comfort in my current predicament. It may even allow me to rid myself of this "junk" that seemed to follow me with every move.

So I set about on the journey of answering that question.

I examined close to 50 open source projects. A collection of the top trending and popular projects found on GitHub. A number of them indispensable tools.

## SLIDE - Legend Slide

I started by drawing a dividing line through each project.

Source code critical to the mission of the application I labeled "core". What remained -- all the models and methods falling outside of the project's domain -- is what I called "junk".

I had a simple goal. Run code quality analysis on each of these two camps of code and compared their scores.

I used Code Climate to give each of these partitions a score from 0.0 to 4.0. A measure of its quality.

0.0 being the lowest. 4.0 being the highest.

If the quality of the "junk" exceeded the "core" quality, I would conclude that the "junk" was helpful to the project. If it was lower, I would conclude the "junk" had made everything worse.

Each project I examined I hoped to find a wealth of data unanimously supporting one claim over the other. But that I would also stumble upon compelling outliers begging for their story told. Paragons of designs. Exemplars of tragedy.

Instead I found something else.

## SLIDE - Project 1 Scores

When I was a teenager, my father lost his job and shortly after his second wife asked for a divorce.

The two of us moved back in with his parents -- my grandparents.

## SLIDE - Project 2 Scores

I slept in the living room. My father on the couch and me on a small bed. We made our home in and around the towering mounds of books, magazines, and knick-knacks spread all throughout the house. Bed sheets, with floral patterns, tucked over top of the overflowing bookcases and draped over long lost tables.

## SLIDE - Project 3 Scores

The living room landscape was ever evolving as these colorfully shrouded dunes grew and shrank. And there somewhere between two dunes lay my bed.

My grandmother was a "junk" collector. In her younger years it was her business. She accepted all manor of things; like books and costume jewelry. Combing through it, sorting it, and then re-selling it to people who would contact here through listings she would place in free circulations.

## SLIDE - Project 4 Scores

It was her obsession. She was a child of the Great Depression.

As she grew older she continued to collect but it became increasingly harder for her to stay ahead of all of it. I was often enlisted to clear tables -- or spaces -- before guests arrived.

## SLIDE - Total Project Scores

... and maybe it's because she passed on recently that I thought about it more - had more questions and more thoughts about the junk she collected.

## SLIDE - BLACK

In her absence all of the things that remained became artifacts; meaningful choices made on vacation in a foreign country or treasures from a loved one. Some of it also represented the "junk" she never had a chance to rid herself of.

## SLIDE - Treasure

"What was the purpose of this junk? What did it do?"

Because an unequivocal answer to that question could help me find comfort in my current predicament. It may even allow me to value the "treasures" that seemed to follow me with every move.

So I set about on another journey of answering that question.

## SLIDE - Tool 1

> Tool Description

There is so much more to the code we write. To all the code that we leave behind. It embodies our limitations and our strengths. It expresses our understanding of the world... and it expresses how we wish we could change the world.

## SLIDE - Tool 2

> Tool Description

We design and engineer architecture that represent ourselves. That express our opinions. And our body of work as a whole expresses what it is we love about the work that we do each day and the truths we sought.

## SLIDE - Tool 3 (HashWithIndifferentAccess)

> Tool Description

When we leave a space, we leave behind so much. Perhaps even more so in our field. Where we commit our thoughts to a history that we share with one another.

## SLIDE - Tool 4

> Tool Description

I am guilty of not stopping to examine the work and the words that others have created. Sometimes it is because I don't know where to look. Sometimes it's because I want to see if I can do it myself. And sometimes ... sometimes I am absolutely sure I can do it better than someone else.

## SLIDE - Question

I found interesting treasures -- marginalized -- because it did not fit within the "core" of the application.

* Is it too cumbersome to create gems?
* Is it too difficult to manage our dependencies?
* Is there a way we can create smaller, light-weight, re-usable dependencies?

## SLIDE - Better or Worse?

Within the "junk" I found so much more than a binary judgment. Better. Worse.

Developers did treat the code within their junk drawers differently. Overall the quality of the "junk" code was better than that of the "core" code.

What I didn't expect to find were all the useful tools and interesting ideas within these junk drawers. Tools confined to the junk drawer because either our framework or our tools still make it less than trivial to manage them separately. Ideas shared across so many projects -- repeating patterns -- suggesting to me that there may be more truths.

## SLIDE - Conclusion ("one project's junk is another project's treasure")

Within the "junk" I found so much more than a binary judgment. Better. Worse.

What I didn't expect to find were all the useful tools and interesting ideas within these junk drawers. Tools confined to the junk drawer because either our framework or our tools or practices still make it less than trivial to manage them. Ideas shared across so many projects -- repeating patterns -- suggesting to me that there may be more truths.

But there is so much more to the code we write. To all the code that we leave behind. It embodies our limitations and our strengths. It expresses our understanding of the world... and it expresses how we wish we could change the world.

We design and engineer architecture that represent ourselves. That express our opinions. And our body of work as a whole expresses what it is we love about the work that we do each day and the truths we sought.

The most interesting thing I found on this journey to answer my questions is that I think I had it wrong. The code core critical to the mission was the junk -- because from what I saw, the junk we write was universal.

So I'm asking that the next time you return to your current coding obsession or project and look for your junk. Rid yourself of it if you can -- and share it with all of us.
